# CS639-BerryCounting
**Goal**

Cranberry is a perennial crop. Estimating the number of cranberry fruits in the cranberry
marshes helps cranberry growers to make better decisions in order to get higher yield with
good fruit quality. The current practice of fruits estimation often involves manually counting
fruits (before harvesting), which is an extremely time-consuming and laborious process in the
large marshes of cranberry fields. There has been little work done in estimating cranberry
fruits in the marshes. We met with cranberry growers and understood there is a need for a
better solution to estimate the number of fruits in the marshes before harvesting and an
important need for an automatic technique to count the cranberry fruits in the marshes. The
fruit counting has many applications which will help cranberry growers to optimize their
management practice and to know the previous year carry over effect in the present year
yields.

**Problem statement**

This study aims to confirm the state of knowledge in the use of CNN method of image
recognition for cranberry fruits detecting and counting using cranberry marshes field images.
The results will be validated with the observed cranberry yield estimations. This study is
found to be very helpful for cranberry growers, researchers and policy makers. This study
required lots of understanding in terms of crop physiology of cranberry and image processing
techniques. The main challenge is that the crop is a shrub crop and morphological features
look small. Hence, developing an automatic computer vision technique is a challenging
process.

**Previous Work**

Research conducted on detecting and counting fruits in plants has used methods ranging from
primitive computer vision techniques to using Convolutional Neural Network architectures.
Some of them are as follows.
1. Applying Image filtration and Hough transformations to isolate the fruits. (Janowski,
Artur, et al, 2021, p.4).
2. Using the Viola-Jones Algorithm for object detection. (Janowski, Artur, et al, 2021,
p.5).
3. Using the YOLO real-time object detection algorithm. (Janowski, Artur, et al, 2021,
p.7)
4. Building CNN models based on CNN architectures like U-Net. (Akiva et al, 2020,
p.4)
5. Using the Faster/Mask-R CNN architecture. (Santos, Thiago T., et al, 2020, p.3)

**Data Collection**

The images data were collected using a mobile phone camera with the required accuracy of
image acquisition and accurate Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning. The
marshes are located at the University of Wisconsin- Madison research stations. The images
are captured from different parts of different marshes to capture the variability of the
marshes. The images were captured in different conditions such as lighting conditions, angles
and orientations.
